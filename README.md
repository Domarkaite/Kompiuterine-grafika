# 🧠 Kompiuterinė Grafika – Computer Graphics Labs

Welcome to the showcase of my university computer graphics labs!  
These are written in JavaScript with Three.js and feature various creative and technical explorations in 3D graphics.  
Scroll down to see demos in action 🎥👇

---

## 📁 Lab 1 – Fractals & Matrix Animations

Exploring recursive fractals and matrix-driven animations.

> 🌀 Recursive drawings and animated matrix transformations.

---

## 📁 Lab 2 – Meshes & Staircases

Experimenting with 3D mesh variations.

> 🪜 A staircase built from different mesh types.

### 🔹 3.2 – Interactive Queen Chess Scene (Three.js)

A real-time 3D chessboard rendered with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), featuring:

- 🧠 **Three camera modes**:  
  Trackball camera, Dolly Zoom camera, and Third-Person tracking camera.
- 👑 **Custom Queen Geometry**:  
  Designed using `LatheGeometry` and placed dynamically.
- 🎮 **Interactive GUI** using [dat.GUI](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui):
  - Switch cameras
  - Adjust the field of view
  - Animate a dolly zoom
- 📸 **Camera object model**: Visualizes a camera as a 3D object in the scene.

| Camera Angle 1 | Camera Angle 2 | Camera Angle 3 |

## 📁 Lab 4 – Teapot Graphics & Lighting

### 🫖 4.1 – Texture Mapping on a Teapot

> Applied 2D graphics textures to a 3D teapot object.

### 💡 4.2 – Custom Lighting & Color Shading

> A custom light point interacts with a teapot surface, casting colours and shadows.
